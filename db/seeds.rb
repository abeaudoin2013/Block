Imitation.create(piece: 'The yarn baby lasted a good month, emitting dry, cotton-soft gurgles and pooping little balls of lint, before Ogechi snagged its thigh on a nail and it unravelled as she continued walking, mistaking its little huffs for the beginnings of hunger, not the cries of an infant being undone. By the time she noticed, it was too late, the leg a tangle of fibre, and she pulled the string the rest of the way to end it, rather than have the infant grow up maimed. If she was to mother a child, to mute and subdue and fold away parts of herself, the child had to be perfect.', title: "Who Will Greet You at Home", author: "Lesley Nneka Arimah")
Imitation.create(piece: 'It started with bedtime. A coldness. A formality. Martin and Rachel tucked the boy in, as was their habit, then stooped to kiss him good night. "Please don’t do that," he said, turning to face the wall. They took it as teasing, flopped onto his bed to nuzzle and tickle him. The boy turned rigid, endured the cuddle, then barked out at them, "I really don’t like that!" "Jonah?" Martin said, sitting up. "I don’t want your help at bedtime anymore,"" he said. "I’m not a baby. You have Lester. Go cuddle with him." "Sweetheart," Rachel said. "We’re not helping you. We’re just saying good night. You like kisses, right? Don’t you like kisses and cuddles? You big silly."', title: "Cold Little Bird", author: "Ben Marcus")
Imitation.create(piece: 'Mark parked his Vespa beside three others outside Yasmin’s school, in Manchester, where it would be safe. Yasmin never bothered going to school on Fridays, so they had to meet elsewhere. The day was dull and drizzly, and Mark had got damp riding into town. He felt a little uncomfortable. His jeans were spotted with mud, but his fingers were warm in nice new gloves. He loved his Vespa. He locked his helmet under the seat and, led by a series of text messages, took the bus three stops to Elmsley Street, where Yasmin said they could make love in an empty house; there was a way in through the garden, she said. She had been there before.', title: "Vespa", author: "Tim Parks")
